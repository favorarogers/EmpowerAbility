            <p>Our programs are designed to help individuals with IDD maintain and expand social and life skills, personal wellness, pre-vocational and vocational skills, and critical thinking skills, while becoming more involved in our community.

            Activities offered are designed to be innovative, enriching, and to promote opportunities for inclusion and the development of life skills through a safe, highly structured schedule of activities.
